Understanding The Problem
Efficiency: They enable quick access, update, and management of large inventories, reducing time complexity.
Scalability: Proper data structures and algorithms handle growth efficiently, ensuring the system scales with inventory size.
Data Integrity: They help maintain consistent and accurate data, minimizing redundancy.

Suitable datastructres are HashMap,ArrayList 

Analysis
Time Complexity Analysis
Add Product: O(n) in the worst case because it checks for duplicates by iterating through the entire list.
Update Product: O(n) because it may need to search through the entire list to find the product.
Delete Product: O(n) for the same reason as updating it must find the product in the list.
