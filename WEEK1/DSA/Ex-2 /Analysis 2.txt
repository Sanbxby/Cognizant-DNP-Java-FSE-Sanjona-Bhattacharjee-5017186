/*Understanding the problem
-Big O Notation:

Describes the upper bound of an algorithm's time or space complexity in the worst-case scenario.


-Best, Average, and Worst-Case Scenarios:

Best Case: The minimum time required for an algorithm to complete.
Average Case: The expected time for an algorithm over all possible inputs.
Worst Case: The maximum time an algorithm can take.*/


/*-Analysis
Linear Search:

-Time Complexity: O(n)
Use Case: Suitable for unsorted data or small datasets.
Binary Search:

-Time Complexity: O(log n)
Use Case: Requires sorted data suitable for large datasets.
