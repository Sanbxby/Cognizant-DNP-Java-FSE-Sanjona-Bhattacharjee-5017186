-Understanding Linked Lists
-Singly Linked List:
 Each node contains data and a reference to the next node.
 Simple structure, efficient for insertions/deletions at the head.
-Doubly Linked List:
 Each node contains data, a reference to the next node, and a reference to the previous node.
 Advantages: Allows for traversal in both directions.


-Analysis
Add Task:
Time Complexity: O(1)
Search Task:
Time Complexity: O(n)
Traverse Tasks:
Time Complexity: O(n)
Delete Task:
Time Complexity: O(n)

-Advantages of Linked Lists over Arrays
Linked lists can grow and shrink dynamically, unlike arrays with fixed sizes.
Adding or removing nodes is efficient if done at the head or if the reference to the node is available, as it does not require shifting elements like in arrays.
