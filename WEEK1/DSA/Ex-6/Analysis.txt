/*-Understanding Search Algorithms
Linear Search:
 Iterates over each element in a list to find a target value.
 O(n) for both average and worst-case scenarios.
Binary Search:
 Efficiently finds a target value in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
 O(log n) for average and worst-case scenarios.*/


/*-Analysis
Linear Search:
Time Complexity: O(n) 
Binary Search:
Time Complexity: O(log n)

-When to Use Linear Search: Suitable for small or unsorted datasets.
-When to Use Binary Search: Best for large, sorted datasets due to its logarithmic time complexity.*/
