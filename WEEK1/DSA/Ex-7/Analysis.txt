/*-Understanding Recursive Algorithms
 A recursive algorithm solves a problem by solving smaller instances of the same problem. It involves a base case to end recursion and a recursive case to reduce the problem size.
 Recursion can simplify complex problems, such as computing sequences or traversing data structures, by breaking them into more manageable sub-problems.*/



/*-Analysis
Time Complexity:
 O(n), where n is the number of periods.

Optimization:
 Store in-process results to avoid redundant calculations
 For large datasets or many periods, an iterative approach  may be preferred.*/
