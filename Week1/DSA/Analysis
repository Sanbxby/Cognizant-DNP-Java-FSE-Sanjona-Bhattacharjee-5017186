-Time Complexity Analysis
Add Product: O(n) in the worst case because it checks for duplicates by iterating through the entire list.
Update Product: O(n) because it may need to search through the entire list to find the product.
Delete Product: O(n) for the same reason as updating it must find the product in the list.

-Optimization Discussion
Hashmap will be the better choice for optimization of bigger data.
